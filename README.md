In this project, I implemented a task scheduler that allows users to simulate and run different CPU scheduling algorithms.
The system asks the user to input a set of processes with attributes like PID, arrival time, burst time, and priority.
The user can then select a scheduling algorithm to simulate, including Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Job First Search (SJFS).
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to make changes or add to this repository
